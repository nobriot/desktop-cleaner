# Don't put stuff on the Desktop!

When we were visiting [Dropzone Denmark](https://www.dropzonedenmark.dk/en),
we noticed on the shared computers that they have a problem to have people
organize their content, and their desktop get polluted.

The best way to prevent people from adding things on your Desktop...
Is to just delete everything automatically ðŸ˜€

## Introducing to you .... the Desktop cleaner

You'll need [cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to build.

Then you can run 

```console
cargo build --release && ./target/release/desktop-cleaner
```

### Install

To build and install, run 

```console
make install
```

It is possible to un-install with 

```console
make uninstall
```

### Options

You can specify the interval at which the desktop cleaning runs, in seconds,
using the `--interval` argument. For example, run every 15 seconds:

```console
desktop-cleaner --interval 15
```

If you want to specify which directory is the home directory
(e.g. clean Desktops of other users), you can use `--home-dir`

```console
desktop-cleaner --home-dir $(pwd)
```

Files can be recovered from the trash-bin, but if you want to test it you can 
run with the `--dry-run` option:

```console
desktop-cleaner --dry-run
```
