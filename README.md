# Don't put stuff on the Desktop!

When we were visiting [Dropzone Denmark](https://www.dropzonedenmark.dk/en),
we noticed on the shared computers that they have a problem to have people
organize their content, and their desktop get polluted.

The best way to prevent people from adding things on your Desktop...
Is to just delete everything automatically ðŸ˜€

## Introducing to you .... the Desktop cleaner

This program puts the files from the desktop to the trash-bin periodically.
It is possible to recover your files from the trash bin, so it's not too destructive.

It will also spare files with the following extensions [`desktop`, `exe`]. 
You can modify the program to change this list.

Symlinks will also survive and be kept.

## Get started

You'll need [cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to build.
Then you can run, sit back and relax ðŸ™‚

```console
cargo build --release && ./target/release/desktop-cleaner
```

For MacOS and Linux, the Makefile will allow you to do this quicker: 

```console
make run
```

```console
make dry-run
```

### Install

To build and install, run 

```console
make install
```

It is possible to un-install with 

```console
make uninstall
```

For Windows, the easiest is probably to run this in the repo:

```console
cargo install --path .
where desktop-cleaner.exe
```

Then you are on your own! 

### Options

You can specify the interval at which the desktop cleaning runs, in seconds,
using the `--interval` argument. For example, run every 15 seconds:

```console
desktop-cleaner --interval 15
```

If you want to specify which directory is the home directory
(e.g. clean Desktops of other users), you can use `--home-dir`

```console
desktop-cleaner --home-dir $(pwd)
```

Files can be recovered from the trash-bin, but if you want to test it you can 
run with the `--dry-run` option:

```console
desktop-cleaner --dry-run
```
